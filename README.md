Hey, I'm Dylan. I write tech posts and articles on various topics. I'm currently between migrating content from my old site to this one. Coming up I'll be focusing on cover Machine Learning topics, starting with the basics; Linear and Logistic regression, so look out for that. 

In the meantime, if you'd like to reach out, my social links are in the page footer.
