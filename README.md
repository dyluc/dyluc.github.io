# Hi, I'm Dylan!

I write tech articles and posts on a variety of topics, mostly whenever I've managed to build something cool enough to share. As of late, that's been Machine Learning focused: practical projects, building architectures from research papers, and maybe the occasional pointless experiment.

I believe the best way to learn is through a hands-on approach, by building, breaking things, and figuring it out as you go.
