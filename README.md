**Hi folks!**

I write tech articles and posts on a variety of topics, mostly whenever I've managed to build something cool enough to share. As of late, that's been Machine Learning focused: forecasting models, building architectures from research papers, a little bit of applied robotics, and maybe the occasional pointless experiment (currently deliberating if I want to waste an afternoon exploring banana kinematics).

My posts are quite infrequent, but I try to put a lot of research and detail into each, so if you like anything you read or have additional questions, please feel free to reach out, I'd love to connect!

You'll find my socials above.
